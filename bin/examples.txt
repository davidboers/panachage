To vote for single list unamended:

    f|1  

Where "1" is the list id. 

To vote for a list with some names struck out (partial list):

    p|2|204,205,206

To vote for a list with some names struck out and others added on:

    p|2|204,205,206|101,105,106

To cast a "free" or "blank" vote:

    b|103,104,106,201

Note that when using the command line, you may need to put your expressions in
quotation marks, because otherwise the shell might think you are trying to use
the pipe function:

    miniparser "f|1"
